# p4labs

This is yet another public repository to share P4 example code fragments.

Current plan is to add examples using BMv2 and Golang P4Runtime Client, but could add more targets in future. (e.g. Tofino)

For instructions how to setup P4 environment, check below page by Andy Fingerhut. (Thank you as always!!)
